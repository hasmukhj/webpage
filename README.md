# Simple Web Page

This project contains a basic static website with a home page and a simple about page.

## Local Run

To serve the pages locally using Python's built-in HTTP server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Then open [http://localhost:8000/index.html](http://localhost:8000/index.html) in your browser for the home page or [http://localhost:8000/about.html](http://localhost:8000/about.html) for the about page.
